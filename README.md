# ✈️ Flight Operations Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing airline flight operations using Power BI. The dashboard evaluates airline performance, operational efficiency, punctuality trends, and cancellation patterns across airports, time periods, and distance categories.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

  - Monitor flight performance KPIs
  - Identify delay and cancellation trends
  - Compare airline operational efficiency
  - Analyze seasonal and time-based operational patterns
  - Provide business-driven recommendations

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations
### KPI Metrics
  - Total Flights
  - Cancelled Flights
  - Cancellation Rate
  - On-Time Departure %
  - Average Air Time

### Analytical Charts
  - Monthly Flight Activity
  - Departure Status Distribution
  - Distance Category Flight Duration
  - Airline Punctuality Comparison
  - Delay Trends by Time of Day
  - Monthly Cancellation Rate
  - Top 10 Airlines by Flight Volume

### 🔍 Key Insights
  - July recorded highest flight activity
